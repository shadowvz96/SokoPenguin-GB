SokoPenguin is a Sokoban-style puzzle game, where you control a penguin who must push boxes to clear the path to its cozy igloo. With each level, the puzzles become more complex, and new mechanics are introduced.

BurterButterBeans Studio here. This is the first game I've designed with the amazing software "GB Studio" version 4.1.3. I had a lot of fun and learned many new things. This game was made especially for the Game Boy Competition 2025.

This is a demake of a beloved, classic Sokoban game called "SokoPenguin". A link can be found below linking to the developer/publisher site. It's available for PC, PS4, PS5, Switch, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S

You can currently play Levels 1-7 and 9-11 for a total of 10 reimagined levels on original Gameboy hardware! Oh, maybe there's a bonus level at the end? You'll have to play through to find out! : )  I hope you enjoy this amazing accomplishment of mine. I appreciate any feedback! Kudos to eastasiasoft for inspiring me to recreate their hidden gem!

As an added bonus, this project is open-source! Learn how the game was made and make your very own Sokoban game! You can move as many as 3 or more crates at the same time with my code and some modular changes. Documentation coming soon! (some assets have been removed: logos, credits, burterPlayer, etc) so you can replace with your own assets. The Game file (.gb) is available in the Downloads Page as well.
